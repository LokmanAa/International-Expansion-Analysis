Educational Systems Data Analysis

In this project, I've analyzed data from educational systems, focusing on univariate analysis and visualizations. This project deepened my skills in Python programming, data exploration, and using Jupyter Notebooks for presenting my findings in a clear and structured way.
 
Key Skills Acquired:

    Python for Data Science: Mastering Python as a tool for data manipulation and analysis using libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
    Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Gaining proficiency in performing univariate analysis, understanding data distributions, and visualizing data through histograms, boxplots, and density plots.
    Data Visualization: Learning how to create and interpret graphical representations of data to better communicate insights to a variety of audiences.
    Jupyter Notebooks: Using Jupyter as an interactive platform for writing code, visualizing results, and collaborating on data-driven projects.

Technologies Used:

    Python: The main programming language used for data manipulation and analysis.
    Pandas: A powerful Python library for handling and analyzing structured data (DataFrames).
    Matplotlib / Seaborn: Libraries for visualizing data through charts, histograms, and other graphical representations.
    Jupyter Notebooks: The environment used to combine code, comments, and visualizations into a structured document for analysis and presentation.
